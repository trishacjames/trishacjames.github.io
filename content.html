        <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
        <p>I am a 26-year-old ATL native (not born, but raised) who is taking on the journey to become a Full Stack software developer. For the past three years, I've flown the friendly skies and was there for the mass' safety as they sat back and relaxed and enjoyed their flight.</p>
        <p>Yes, I was a flight attendant...</p>
        <p>Although I loved having the chance to travel the world, I grew tired of the lifestyle and decided I wanted to learn a new skill that would provide me a number of opportunities for a rewarding career in software development. Even though I am going to have a career change, travel will always be a part of my life in some way.</p>
        <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
        <p>I am constantly kicking myself for having one of the most expensive hobbies in existence (this is probably not factual, but it sure feels that way). I am a Carnival Chaser. A carnival chaser is someone who will travel far and wide to experience the europhic feeling of Caribbean carnival. The colors, the costumes, the feathers, the music, the people and the vibes combined is the greatest feeling to me! My next carnival will be in Atlanta and I'm hopinig to go Grenada in the fall. I have gone to Trinidad (twice), Miami, and New York for their respective carnivals, but my goal is to experience carnival on every Caribbean island.</p>
